<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a efficient and ecologically sensitive  technique to pest management that depends on a combination of common-sense practices. IPM is an approach to guarantee economic practicality at both consumer and manufacturer level (seller is always anticipated to make a profit), ecological safety through a well balanced usage of all offered pest control alternatives, and social acceptability given that IPM-based food is economical and safe.</p>
<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of environmentally unsound approaches as well as its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the possibility that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Subsidies on pesticides were decreased from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and removed completely by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - suggests a typical method of ruining pests as it happens in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the requirement to handle substantial populations that might trigger crop damage. Safety problems and environmental interruptions continue to take place (Wright, 1996 ), and there are renewed appeals for efficient, safe, and economically acceptable options (Benbrook, 1996 ). Artificial chemical pesticides are the most commonly used technique of pest control. </p>
<p>Usually, the primary goal of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally developed for farming pest management, IPM programmes are now established to incorporate diseases, weeds, and other pests that may hinder the management goals of sites such as residential and industrial structures, lawn and grass areas, and house and community gardens.</p>
