<p>This technique describes making use of a range of physical or mechanical techniques for pest exemption, trapping (in some cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
