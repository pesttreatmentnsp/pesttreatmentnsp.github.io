<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable approach that integrates practices for the economic prevention and control of pests and illness in crops.  Special precautions must be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic technique to pest control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a number of the same concepts as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
<p>The variety of plants examined will depend upon factors such as the value of the crop, possible issues and size and type of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates different types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to standard artificial pesticides-- in a reasonable, long-lasting plan. Biopesticides are typically compatible with natural enemies, but there are exceptions.</p>
