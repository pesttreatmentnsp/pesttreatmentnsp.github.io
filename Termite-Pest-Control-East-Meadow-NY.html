<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
