The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, flies and bees are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
